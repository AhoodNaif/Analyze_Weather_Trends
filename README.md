# Analyze_Weather_Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Nano-degree - Project I
# Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

# Software Used

1. SQL
2. Excel
3. Extracting Data

# To start I wrote an SQL query to retrieve all the temperature data from:

Local Database (Mecca)
Global Database
Upon retrieving the data, it was extracted on a CSV file for further evaluation.

# Data Selection & Manipulation
Once the data has been extracted on CSV, it was possible to further evaluate the data on Excel.

Moreover, due to fluctuations in yearly averages, the data was evaluated considering moving averages (7-years) to provide smoother results during data visualization.

# Observations 
1. The differences between Mecca and Global temp is quite consistent over time and not changed. 
2. The changes in temperature for Mecca city is increasing over time as the change in the global temperature that also increase over   time.
3. It seem from the last few hundred years in the global temperature that the change is quite little over time but it is in increasing manner
